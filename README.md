# Diepio Script Loader
Load custom d.js file for Diepio

Modify background.js if you want to switch from local to internet d.js file

Such as if you clone and have your own d.js file on github

However in that case you'd need to use rawgit.com to avoid a MIME type check

If diep.io updates, you will need to download the new d.js, move your modifications from the
old d.js version to the new one, and put it in the extension folder (chrome_ext). It's a good idea
to keep a backup of all your d.js modified files just in case you deleted something important

Diep.io d.js files can update without the changelog reflecting it. These are usually small updates,
but still will give you an error if you don't update your d.js
